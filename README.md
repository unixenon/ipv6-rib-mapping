# ipv6-rib-mapping
A mostly vibe coded but still cool project that makes a map of IPv6 prefixes in the Routing Information Base (or really any set of prefixes). It's meant to sort of recreate what bgp.tools has for their IPv4 internet map. Of course pinging every IPv6 address isn't really feasible, but it's still interesting to see what's registered.
